## 1. Getting to know the data
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(DBI)

witch_con <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(),
      dbname = "witchcraft",
      host = "tbrambor.cqejfaflibld.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com",
      port = 3306,
      user = "student",
      password = "mds-is-fun")

witch_con
```

```{sql, connection = "witch_con"}
SHOW TABLES

```

```{sql, connection = "witch_con"}
DESCRIBE accused

```

```{sql, connection = "witch_con"}
SELECT COUNT(firstname) as "# of people accused"
FROM accused

```

```{sql, connection = "witch_con"}
SELECT firstname, sex, age
FROM accused
LIMIT 5

```


```{sql, connection = "witch_con"}
SELECT COUNT(age) as "# of valid data for age"
FROM accused
WHERE age <> ""

```

```{sql, connection = "witch_con"}
SELECT DISTINCT(occupation) "unique occupations"
FROM accused

```

##2..Seeing the Devil
```{sql, connection = "witch_con"}

SELECT DISTINCT(devil_type) as "types of devils"
FROM devilappearance
```

```{sql, connection = "witch_con"}
SELECT COUNT(devil_text) as "Devil Text Contains 'Black'"
FROM   devilappearance
WHERE  devil_text LIKE 'black%' OR '%black' OR '%Black' OR 'Black%'

```
```{sql, connection = "witch_con"}
SELECT ROUND((P.subtotal/P.total)*100) as "Proportion of Devil Type: Male (%)"
FROM(
     SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN devil_type IN ('Male') then 1 ELSE NULL END ) subtotal,
            COUNT(devil_type) total
       FROM devilappearance 
     ) P
   
```

##3. The trial
```{sql, connection = "witch_con"}
SELECT ROUND(AVG(female_accusers + male_accusers)) as "Avg # of Accusers Per Trial"
FROM   trial
WHERE female_accusers <> "" OR male_accusers <> ""

```

```{sql, connection = "witch_con"}
SELECT ROUND(MAX(female_accusers + male_accusers)) "Max # of Accusers Per Trial"
FROM   trial
WHERE female_accusers <> "" OR male_accusers <> ""

```

```{sql, connection = "witch_con"}
SELECT sentence as "Sentence", COUNT(sentence) as "# of Sentences"
FROM trial
WHERE sentence <> ""
GROUP BY sentence
ORDER BY COUNT(sentence) DESC

```
##Based on the output, it seems like guilty verdicts have the highest average number of accusers.
```{sql, connection = "witch_con"}
SELECT verdict as "Verdict", ROUND(AVG(female_accusers + male_accusers)) as "Avg # of Accusers"
FROM trial
WHERE verdict <> "" AND female_accusers <> "" OR male_accusers <> ""
GROUP BY verdict
ORDER BY ROUND(AVG(female_accusers + male_accusers)) DESC

```
